                            <span>
                                On February 15th, 2015, my family took the plunge and 
                                welcomed our first dog into our home - a Jack Russell 
                                terrier named George. We were excited to have a new furry companion 
                                and were hopeful that George would bring joy and companionship to our family. 
                                George was just a puppy at the time, and he was a little ball 
                                of energy, always running around and causing mischief. But he 
                                was also extremely loyal and affectionate, and it didn't take 
                                long for us to fall in love with him. George quickly became an 
                                important member of our family, and we were grateful to have him by our side.

                                George is an energetic little dog, but even he needs to rest 
                                and relax from time to time. When it's time for George to catch 
                                some Z's, he has a special routine that he follows. First, he 
                                likes to spin around in a circle to the right, probably to get 
                                all of his energy out before settling down. Then, he finds a cozy 
                                spot, curls up in a ball, and dozes off into a peaceful slumber. 
                                George is a light sleeper, and he is always alert and ready to go 
                                on his next adventure. But when he's tired, he knows how to relax 
                                and get some rest, and it's always fun to watch him doze off 
                                and enjoy some well-deserved rest.

                                George has made many amazing furry friends throughout his life, 
                                but two of his closest companions are Gretchen, an old German 
                                shepherd who used to live across the street, and Trixie, a rat 
                                terrier whose owners are the Lockerbies. Despite her age, Gretchen 
                                still tries to act tough and keep up with George's energetic personality, 
                                but ultimately she always submits to his playful nature. Trixie, on the 
                                other hand, is a feisty little dog who is always ready for a play session 
                                with George. Despite their differences in size and breed, these dogs 
                                have formed a strong bond with George and always have a great time with him.
